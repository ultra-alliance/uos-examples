# UOS Examples

Welcome to the UOS Projects Exmaples repository!
This repository aims to provide you with a collection of boilerplate projects to help you get started with building applications on the UOS.

## What is the UOS?

A carbon neutral blockchain infrastructure to power Ultra's App ecosystem. Already used for Ultra Games, a mass-market ready games distribution platform, and now you can too.

This repository is organized into separate directories, each containing a boilerplate project for a specific stack. The current list of supported technologies includes:

### C++ Smart Contracts

For developing EOSIO based smart contracts on the Ultra Blockchain using C++.
Test your contracts in:
- [JavaScript](/README.md)
- [TypeScript](/README.md)

---

Each directory contains its own README file with detailed instructions on how to set up and run the boilerplate project.

## Getting Started

To get started with a specific boilerplate project, navigate to the corresponding directory and follow the instructions provided in the `README.md` file. You can also use the [`ultradev CLI`](https://docs.ultra-alliance.tech/modules/ultradev.html) to create a new project from a template.

Make sure you have the necessary tools and dependencies installed for the chosen technology stack. This may include software such as Node.js, npm, Python, Solidity compiler, and others, depending on the project.
